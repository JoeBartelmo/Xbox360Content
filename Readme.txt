Description: The goal of this project is to outdo previous projects made by others across the web, and to help improve the audiences understanding on the way the systems work on the Xbox 360. This project will also provide an API to the website: http://Xbox360Content.com/ so that users may view their accounts, for use with their own program. By the end of this project, it will include an STFS system, FATX system, Binary Reading/Writing, an API (previously mentioned), a Logging System, and several other items that will assist users when working with the DLL.
